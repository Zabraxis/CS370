# Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: 
# What code were you given? 
# The project started with giving me a basic environment for the intelligent agent to live in, basic reinforcement learning algorithms, and preset some neural networks 
#     and functions to begin.
#What code did you create yourself?
# I had to add some code to this to develop the functionality of the agent and make it complete. The additions included a training network for the agent that were dependent on 
#     the environment that the agent was in, and the ability to learn the most rewarding path to choose over time. There needed to be some visualization data added as well as an #     analysis of the performance of the agent for each run, included a win rate.
# What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
# Computer scientists do a great many things, such as creating algorithms to tackle problems that affect everyone, every day. It is a great resource that most people are         #     probably clueless about even using. Computer science is a staple in todays world, even keeping the user unaware of it being used at times. Data being collected is talked 
#     about often, but the geenral population thinks nothing of it on a daily basis.
# How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
# Approaching a problem for me is a simple matter of learning as much as possible about the problem first, then creating small steps to solve the problem, with a lot of trial   #     and error involved, brute force attack it head on. The basic outline is the first step, then create little modules of fixes, one step at a time, test the result, if it    #     works, great, if it does not work, try again. By using past experiences, I have learned that trial and error is the most effective method for me to get things done,       #     perhaps not the best way, but it works for me, searching for information, and looking at something I have done befoe often helps with the process.
# What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
# Ethical responsibilities should not be a consideration beyond, be as ethical as possible. Keeping everything fair and unbiased with the highest level of security should always #     be the goal for anyone, not just myself. As someone who has never worked for a business, I could see how the lines get blurred with business, but it should never happen    #    that way, mistakex can and will happen, but, if the effort is made to be secure and do everything correctly the first time, it should never become an issue.
